# Content-Provider-Demo1
This is a sample app to understand the usage of Content Providers in Android. Specifically, audio files.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the technicalities of __"Content Providers"__ in Android. I wanted to query all the audio files that are stored in the shared storage of the user's phone and show it as a list with album art. Juts like how Music Player applications do.
